Targeting Endpoint Security Post-BSOD

Query 1: Detect Disabling of CrowdStrike or Endpoint Security Services

let timeFrame = 1d;
SecurityEvent
| where TimeGenerated >= ago(timeFrame)
| where EventID == 7040 // Windows Event ID for service state changes
| where ServiceName in ("CrowdStrike", "AV", "EndpointSecurity") // Add other relevant security services
| where ServiceStatus == "Stopped"
| summarize ServiceStopCount = count() by Computer, ServiceName, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where ServiceStopCount > 2 // Threshold for unusual activity


Query 2: Detect Modifications to Security Software Configuration

let timeFrame = 1d;
SecurityEvent
| where TimeGenerated >= ago(timeFrame)
| where EventID == 4657 // Windows Event ID for registry value changes
| where RegistryKey matches regex @"HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\(CrowdStrike|AV|EndpointSecurity)\\.*"
| summarize ModificationCount = count() by Computer, RegistryKey, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where ModificationCount > 2 // Threshold for unusual activity


Query 3: Detect Anomalous Network Traffic Post-BSOD

let timeFrame = 1d;
let bsodEvents = SecurityEvent
| where TimeGenerated >= ago(timeFrame)
| where EventID == 41 // Windows Event ID for unexpected shutdowns (BSOD)
| project Computer, TimeGenerated;
let unusualTrafficThreshold = 100MB;
NetworkSecurityGroupEvent
| where TimeGenerated >= ago(timeFrame)
| join kind=inner (bsodEvents) on Computer
| where Direction == "Outbound"
| summarize TotalBytesSent = sum(SentBytes) by Computer, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where TotalBytesSent > unusualTrafficThreshold
